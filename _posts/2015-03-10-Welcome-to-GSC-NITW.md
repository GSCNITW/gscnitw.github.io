Hello friend from the web! How do you do?

Google Student Club NIT Warangal with more than 50 ebullient active student participants , two energitic organisers and three mesmerizing talented mentors, has turned two weeks old and doing really well with weekly sessions, assignments and occasional swags from Google. Feedback seems great and student participants are so interested though it is the first time for few of them to participate in a study group/club.

We at GSC-NITW aim to form an Android Student study group which introduces development in android to students of NIT Warangal. We look forward to bring professionals to conduct workshops, hackathons where various small businesses/firms/entrepreneurs come up with problems/tasks and student participants along with mentors hack'em overnight and what not!

These can be few common questions that rose up in your mind,

####Who is this for?
>Someone who knows Java, and using Android. It also helps intermediate developers as well. Also, those students who are passionate to begin mobile App development.
Although, there are few Freshers and sophomores who have little knowledge of Java and we still teach them the basics of Java.

####What we want to do?
+ Form an Android Study group
+ Convert learning of skill to building apps
+ Student Mentor and student heirarchy in study groups

####What we expect from you?
+ Time commitment, you should be able to spend 6 Hours/week
+ Stay motivated
+ Be innovative

####Why did we start this website?
+ So that you can get a reference of what is being taught in the sessions
+ Learn extra tricks and techniques
+ More design principles and
+ innovative ways of hacking a problem

So, stay tuned for all the upcoming posts and start getting your hands dirty by coding ;)
